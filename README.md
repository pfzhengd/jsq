# Calculator (React + TypeScript + Vite)

A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with clear/delete controls and decimal input. UI matches the provided layout reference.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start the dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally

## Notes
- Division by zero shows `Error` instead of crashing.
- `C` clears everything; `DEL` removes the last digit.
- `=` spans two rows on the grid to mirror the reference design.
